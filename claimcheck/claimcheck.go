	"Such text dilutes the real information, reads as machine-written so that the reader trusts even the true facts less, and signals that the writer did not think about this reader and situation. " +
	"It is hollow only if all three hold: (1) interchangeable: with only the names swapped it would fit any other document unchanged; " +
	"(2) functionless: removing it loses the reader nothing; " +
	"(3) uncheckable weight: it asserts an evaluation that cannot be verified, or its form is the message. " +
	"For a borderline unit ask: without this unit, would the document read as more trustworthy and faster to the reader? If yes, it is hollow. If removing it makes the document colder or impolite (greetings, thanks, a formal letter's conventions), it is expression, not hollow. " +
